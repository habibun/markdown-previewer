# Markdown Features

Sometimes it's useful to have different **levels of headings** to structure your documents. Start lines with a \`#\` to create headings. Multiple \`##\` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one \`#\` all the way up to \`######\` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to **quote** someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even make a [link](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)

### Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

### Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

If you want to **embed images**, this is how you do it:

And of course you can **style code** with markdown:

\`\`\`
if (isAwesome) {
  return true;
}
\`\`\`

`;

export default sampleMarkdown;
